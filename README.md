# AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty Exam 
## Overview
This is a collection of simple notebooks on a number of topics that from a number of sources (A Cloud Guru, Udemy, Reddit etc) that I am using in preperation for taking the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty. These notebooks are usually in Python or Scala and are not particulalry complicated, but are more for explaining concepts at a high level which are covered in the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty Exam.
